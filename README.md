KANBAN BOARD INSTRUCTIONS
When a card is picked up from the TODO and moved to doing, edit the note with the name of the person who is actively working on that card. 
When complete with that card, move the card to the NEEDS REVIEW column and another member will review the card and edit it to say XY or Z person 
reviewed it and moved it to the COMPLETE column.

Project Description: Case Study 
In the security research paper, the student will analyze how cloud-based Serverless computing impacts its security development in general. 
The student reflects on security principles, researches the current adversarial environment, identifies system vulnerabilities subject to exploitation in the 
serverful environment, and explores remedies to thwart these threats in the serverless computing environment. For example, a student can research 
Serverless computing architecture security and quality analysis for back-end development or on software quality and security can be improved 
using the serverless computing technology.

Proposal

-Identify which of the case studies provided by you and you will be using for your Security Research Paper.

-Write a methodology and thesis statement. This should include where you will get your sources for your literature review, 
how many sources, and what kind of review of the sources you will do (i.e., what you're trying to extract from the research). 

-Create a time-line for the completion of the paper from start to finish. (For example: By the end of week 5, I will have my 
three of my sources found and one of them annotated; by the end of week 6, I will have two more sources and annotated four 
of them; by the end of week 7, I will have completed my outline and annotated bibliography.)
Refer to the headings and guidelines for the sections to be covered in your final paper.

Progress Report

-Identify which of the case studies provided you will be using for your Security Research Paper.

-Write a methodology and thesis statement. This should include where you'll get your sources for your literature review, 
how many sources, and what kind of review of the sources you will do (i.e., what you're trying to extract from the research). 

-Refer to the headings and guidelines for the sections to be covered in your final paper.

Final Report
Formulate and write the paper using the following headings and guidelines (they don't have to be exactly matched but highly encouraged).
	-Introduction to Serverless Computing
		Provide background on Serverless computing
	-Serverless Computing Providers (comparison)
		-Identify the improvement from Serverful computing from a Software Quality Point of View.
	-Compare and contrast different providers.
		-General Security Issues in Serverless and Serverful Computing Environment
		-Compare and contrast the benefits and drawbacks between different Serverless Computing Services in defenses to the vulnerability.
		-Any Security Services to Cloud Architecture such as Application layer transport security in Cloud
	-Security Measures or Remedies Available in Serverless Computing  
		-(e.g.) Authentication and Authorization Models in Various Providers
		-Access Management, Logging or Monitor Services, Encryption, etc.
		-Any limitations exposed.

Conclusion 
-Choose and describe which remedy(s) or defense(s) should be adopted for a particular situation and why based on your analysis and 
professional or academic sources in Serverless computing.
-Future of Security Measures in Serverless Computing.
